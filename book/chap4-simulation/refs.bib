  abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein-protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-{$\alpha$}-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD {$\leq$} 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

  abstract = {The complexity of matrix multiplication is measured in terms of {$\omega$}, the smallest real number such that two n {\texttimes} n matrices can be multiplied using O(n{$\omega$}+âˆŠ) field operations for all âˆŠ {$>$} 0; the best bound until now is {$\omega$} {$<$} 2.37287 [Le Gall'14]. All bounds on {$\omega$} since 1986 have been obtained using the so-called laser method, a way to lower-bound the `value' of a tensor in designing matrix multiplication algorithms. The main result of this paper is a refinement of the laser method that improves the resulting value bound for most sufficiently large tensors. Thus, even before computing any specific values, it is clear that we achieve an improved bound on {$\omega$}, and we indeed obtain the best bound on {$\omega$} to date: {$\omega$} {$<$} 2.37286. The improvement is of the same magnitude as the improvement that [Le Gall'14] obtained over the previous bound [Vassilevska W.'12]. Our improvement to the laser method is quite general, and we believe it will have further applications in arithmetic complexity.},

  abstract = {Computational complexity is one of the most beautiful fields of modern mathematics, and it is increasingly relevant to other sciences ranging from physics to biology. But this beauty is often buried underneath layers of unnecessary formalism, and exciting recent results like interactive proofs, cryptography, and quantum computing are usually considered too "advanced" to show to the typical student. The aim of this book is to bridge both gaps by explaining the deep ideas of theoretical computer science in a clear and enjoyable fashion, making them accessible to non computer scientists and to computer scientists who finally want to understand what their formalisms are actually telling. This book gives a lucid and playful explanation of the field, starting with P and NP-completeness. The authors explain why the P vs. NP problem is so fundamental, and why it is so hard to resolve. They then lead the reader through the complexity of mazes and games; optimization in theory and practice; randomized algorithms, interactive proofs, and pseudorandomness; Markov chains and phase transitions; and the outer reaches of quantum computing. At every turn, they use a minimum of formalism, providing explanations that are both deep and accessible. The book is intended for graduates and undergraduates, scientists from other areas who have long wanted to understand this subject, and experts who want to fall in love with this field all over again.}

  abstract = {We introduce the concept of mode-k generalized eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a tensor and prove some properties of such eigenpairs. In particular, we derive an upper bound for the number of equivalence classes of generalized tensor eigenpairs using mixed volume. Based on this bound and the structures of tensor eigenvalue problems, we propose two homotopy continuation type algorithms to solve tensor eigenproblems. With proper implementation, these methods can find all equivalence classes of isolated generalized eigenpairs and some generalized eigenpairs contained in the positive dimensional components (if there are any). We also introduce an algorithm that combines a heuristic approach and a Newton homotopy method to extract real generalized eigenpairs from the found complex generalized eigenpairs. A MATLAB software package, TenEig, has been developed to implement these methods. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of TenEig for computing complex or real generalized eigenpairs.},

This is a book for those who aim to become professional scientific computing programmers. Before reading it, please make sure

- the problem you are trying to solve runs more than 10min,
- you want to become a tool builder rather than tools user, and you are happy to write the tool with the #link("https://julialang.org/")[Julia] programming language.

The codes in this book are available in the GitHub repository: #link("https://github.com/GiggleLiu/ScientificComputingDemos")[GiggleLiu/ScientificComputingDemos].

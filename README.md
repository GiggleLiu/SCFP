# Scientific Computing for Physicists

This is a book for those who aim to become professional scientific computing programmers. Before reading it, please make sure

- the problem you are trying to solve runs more than 10min,
- you want to become a tool builder rather than tools user, and you are happy to write the tool with the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) programming language.

The codes in this book are available in the GitHub repository: [GiggleLiu/ScientificComputingDemos](https://github.com/GiggleLiu/ScientificComputingDemos).

## Development

The book is built with [Shiroa](https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/shiroa).

To deploy the book locally, run in a terminal
```bash
shiroa serve
```

Make sure you have the latest version of Shiroa installed.
